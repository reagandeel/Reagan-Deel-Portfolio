# Reagan Deel Portfolio

## Description

This project is the start to designing my professional portfolio for future employers' to reference and review my designs. I built this project to begin to showcase and keep inventory of the projects that I have completed within the bootcamp. This beginner portfolio shows off the two projects I have completed, as well as taught me about using the flex-box in CSS, positioning images on the webpage, setting an image as a link in HTML, and more.
